The terms Collection and Collections are different concepts in Java, and they are often confused due to their similar names. Here’s the distinction:

1. Collection (Interface):
	•	Definition: Collection is a root interface in the Java Collections Framework (part of java.util package). It defines the basic structure for data collections (e.g., lists, sets, queues).
	•	Key Features:
	•	It is part of the hierarchy that other interfaces like List, Set, and Queue extend.
	•	Provides methods like add(), remove(), size(), iterator(), etc.
	•	Examples of Subinterfaces:
	•	List (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList)
	•	Set (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet)
	•	Queue (e.g., PriorityQueue, LinkedList)
	•	Usage:

Collection<String> collection = new ArrayList<>();
collection.add("Hello");
collection.add("World");
System.out.println(collection.size()); // Output: 2

2. Collections (Class):
	•	Definition: Collections is a utility class in the Java Collections Framework that provides static methods to operate on or return collections (e.g., sorting, searching, shuffling, making collections unmodifiable).
	•	Key Features:
	•	Contains helper methods to manipulate or enhance collections.
	•	Common methods include sort(), reverse(), shuffle(), synchronizedList(), etc.
	•	Usage:

List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(3);
list.add(1);
list.add(2);

// Sort the list
Collections.sort(list);
System.out.println(list); // Output: [1, 2, 3]

// Reverse the list
Collections.reverse(list);
System.out.println(list); // Output: [3, 2, 1]

Key Differences:

Aspect	Collection	Collections
Type	Interface	Utility class
Purpose	Defines basic structure and behavior of data	Provides helper methods to manipulate data
Hierarchy	Parent interface for List, Set, Queue	No hierarchy (final class with static methods)
Examples	List, Set, Queue	Collections.sort(), Collections.shuffle()

Summary:
	•	Use Collection when defining or working with groups of objects (e.g., List, Set).
	•	Use Collections when you need to manipulate or enhance a collection with utility methods.
