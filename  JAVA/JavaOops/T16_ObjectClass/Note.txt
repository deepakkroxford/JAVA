What is Object Class?
Sol-
The Object class is the most basic and fundamental class in Java. Every other class in Java automatically inherits from the Object class. Here’s a simple explanation of its main features:
1.	Universal Parent Class: All classes in Java are directly or indirectly derived from the Object class. This means that methods defined in Object are available to all Java objects.
2.	Common Methods:

 The Object class provides several key methods that all Java objects can use:
 •	equals(Object obj): Checks if two objects are equal.
 •	hashCode(): Returns a hash code for the object, used in hashing algorithms and data structures like HashMap.
 •	toString(): Returns a string representation of the object.
 •	clone(): Creates and returns a copy of the object.
 •	finalize(): Called by the garbage collector before the object is destroyed.
 •	getClass(): Returns the runtime class of the object.
 •	notify(), notifyAll(), wait(), wait(long timeout), wait(long timeout, int nanos): Methods for thread synchronization.
