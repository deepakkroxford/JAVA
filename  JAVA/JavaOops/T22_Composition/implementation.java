         * Inheritance = Tight Coupling
         * When you use inheritance:
         * 
         * The child class is tightly connected to the parent.
         * 
         * Any change in the parent class can break the child class.
         * 
         * The child class cannot change the behavior of the parent without overriding.
         * 
         * You cannot swap the parent for something else easily.
         * 
         * 
         * When you use composition:
         * The class just uses another class as a field.
         * 
         * You can easily replace or change the inner object.
         * 
         * Less risk: changes in one class donâ€™t break the other.
         * 
         * Supports interfaces for true flexibility.
