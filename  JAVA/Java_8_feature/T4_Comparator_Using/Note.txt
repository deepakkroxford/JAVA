What is Comprator?
sol:
In Java, a Comparator is a functional interface that defines a method for comparing two objects of the same type.
It is used to provide custom comparison logic, which is particularly useful for sorting collections of objects.

The Comparator conation only one abstract method called ** compare **;
this method take two obejct to campare
Syntax:
public int (Object obj1, Object obj2); 
return -1 if obj1 comes before obj2
return 1 if obj1 comes  after obj2
return 0 if obj1 and obj2 are equal


In collection frame work if we want to do sorting so we can easly use the Comparator or Comprable.
and we know that these are functional inference so we can easily use lambda expression with them,
to consise the code.
