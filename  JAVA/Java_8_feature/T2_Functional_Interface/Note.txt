What is functional Interface in java 8?
sol:
A functional Interface in java is a Interface that contain only one abstract method.
It may also declare other methods, such as  static method  or default method or private mathod,
but it must have only one abstract method to qualify as a functional Interface.

Characteristics of a Functional Interface:
1.	Single Abstract Method (SAM):
A functional interface must declare exactly one abstract method. This method defines the contract that implementing classes must adhere to.

2.	Functional Interface Annotation:
While not strictly necessary, using the @FunctionalInterface annotation is a good practice to clearly mark an interface as intended 
for functional programming. This annotation ensures that the interface meets the criteria of having exactly one abstract method.

3.	Compatibility with Lambda Expressions:
Functional interfaces are designed to be compatible with lambda expressions and method references.
Lambda expressions provide a concise way to implement the single abstract method defined by the functional interface.
