What is construcotr in java?
Sol: *A name of the construcotr is same as the class name.* *The construcotr has no return value like int ,float ,void also.*
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.
In Java, a Constructor is a block of codes similar to the method.At the time of calling the constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory
* Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called *


class Person  {
  String name;
  int age;
  we can set the name and age also here but we have to follow the standard .Whenever we want to perform the operation like calculation
  or assign the value,we have to do into the method.so construcotr is like special method.

  //inisilizing constructor
  public Person()
  {
    //we set the initail name and age 
    name="aman";
    age=12;
    System.out.println("hii i am in constructor");
  }
}

Note: It is not necessary to write a constructor for a class. It is because the java compiler creates a default constructor 
(constructor with no arguments) if your class doesnâ€™t have any.

Constructors are called only once at the time of Object creation while method(s) can be called any number of times.

>A constructor can not be overridden.
In Java, constructors cannot be overridden because they are not inherited like regular methods.
However, you can achieve similar behavior through constructor chaining, where a subclass constructor
calls a superclass constructor.

class Parent {
    Parent() {
        System.out.println("Parent constructor");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
        super(); // Calls the parent constructor using super method we can call the parent class constructer
        System.out.println("Child constructor");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child child = new Child();
    }
}
Output
Parent constructor
Child constructor
