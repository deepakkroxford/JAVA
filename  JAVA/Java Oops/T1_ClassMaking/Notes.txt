    What is class?
    Ans-> In simple words, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in programming.
    It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from 
    the class will have.
      
     ***  Class doesnt take space in the memory.
      
    Key Points:
    Attributes: These are the characteristics or properties of the class.
    For example, in a Car class, attributes might include color, model, and year.

    Methods: These are the actions or behaviors that objects of the class can perform. 
    For example, in a Car class, methods might include drive(), brake(), and honk().

class Car
{
    //Attributes
    String brand;
    String color;
    int price;

    //methods
    public void infoCar()
    {
        System.out.println(this.brand);
        System.out.println(this.color);
        System.out.println(this.price);
    }

}

public class Bassic {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       Car car = new Car();
       car.infoCar(); // this give us the vlaue null
       car.brand="bmw";
       car.color="black";
       car.price=199999;
       car.infoCar(); // this give us the actual value that we set
       
    }

}
