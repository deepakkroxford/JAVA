Need Of Wrapper Class
1.Conversion Between Primitive Types and Objects: Wrapper classes encapsulate primitive data types (like int, float, boolean) into objects. This allows these primitive types to be used in contexts where objects are required,
such as in collections (like ArrayList) or when dealing with generics.

2.Nullability:
Unlike primitive types, wrapper classes can hold null values. This is useful when you need to represent absence of a value in situations where primitives cannot hold null.

3.Methods and Utility:
Wrapper classes provide methods to perform various utility operations on the underlying primitive types.
For example, Integer provides methods like parseInt() for parsing strings to integers.

4.Compatibility with Generics:
Generics in Java do not support primitive types directly. Using wrapper classes allows primitive types to be used with generics
